# Housing Prices Prediction
Developed a model that predicts price estimates based on properties characteristics and analyzed Boston housing prices dataset using Python. See file "Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model.ipynb".

# Project Description
This Data Science project explored a real estate development company that wants to value any residential projects. I built a model that provides price estimates based on a home's characteristics including number of rooms, distance to employment centers, determine income area, students per teacher affecting property prices, etc. In this project, I coded in Python to analyze and explore Boston house price data, split data for training and testing, run a multivariable regression, evaluate model's coefficients, implement data transformation to improve model's performance, and utilizing model to make predictions of estimated property price. 

# Technologies
These are the technologies that are utilized for this project:
  1. The entire project was coded in Python
  2. Python libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
  3. Completed in Jupyter Notebook to explain code and display datasets, data visualizations, and linear regression algorithms
